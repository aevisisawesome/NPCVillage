# ðŸŽ¯ Final Setup Guide - Single System Prompt

## âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

The contextual movement system is fully implemented with both `move` and `move_to` actions working perfectly.

## ðŸ”§ **SIMPLIFIED CONFIGURATION**

**IMPORTANT CHANGE:** The system now uses **only one system prompt** configured in LM Studio. The hardcoded prompt in `llm_client.py` has been removed.

## ðŸ“‹ **LM Studio Setup (Required)**

### 1. System Prompt
Copy the **entire content** from `lm_studio_system_prompt_new.txt` and paste it into LM Studio's system prompt field.

### 2. JSON Schema  
Copy the **entire content** from `lm_studio_schema.json` and paste it into LM Studio's JSON schema field.

### 3. Restart
Completely restart LM Studio and reload your model.

## ðŸŽ® **Expected Behavior**

| Player Input | Expected Response | Action Type |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| "hello" | `{"action":"say","args":{"text":"..."}}` | Speech |
| "step aside" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":0.5}}` | Small movement |
| "move east" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":1.0}}` | Normal movement |
| "walk away" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"W","distance":3.0}}` | Large movement |
| "go to 5,5" | `{"action":"move_to","args":{"x":5,"y":5}}` | Coordinate movement |

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python test_single_system_prompt.py

# Test movement distances  
python test_distance_calculation.py

# Test move_to action
python test_move_to_close.py

# Test greeting vs movement
python test_greeting_vs_movement.py
```

## âœ… **What's Working**

1. **Single system prompt** - Only configured in LM Studio (no hardcoded prompt)
2. **Contextual distances** - LLM chooses 0.5, 1.0, or 3.0 tiles based on context
3. **Autonomous movement** - Both `move` and `move_to` continue until completion
4. **Proper action selection** - Greetings â†’ speech, movement requests â†’ movement

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits of Single Prompt**

- âœ… **Easier updates** - Change prompt in LM Studio without code changes
- âœ… **No duplication** - Single source of truth
- âœ… **Standard approach** - Matches how most people use LM Studio
- âœ… **Flexible** - Can experiment with different prompts easily

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

If the LLM responds incorrectly:
1. âœ… Verify LM Studio system prompt is completely replaced (not appended)
2. âœ… Verify JSON schema is active and correct
3. âœ… Restart LM Studio completely
4. âœ… Clear any conversation history
5. âœ… Check that the model is loaded properly

## ðŸŽ‰ **Ready to Use!**

Your NPC now has intelligent, contextual movement with both directional and coordinate-based options, all controlled by a single, clean system prompt in LM Studio!
