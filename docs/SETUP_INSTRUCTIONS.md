# ðŸŽ¯ LM Studio Setup Instructions

## âœ… IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE!

The new contextual movement distance system is **100% implemented and working**. All that's needed is updating your LM Studio configuration.

## ðŸ“‹ LM Studio Configuration Steps

### 1. Update System Prompt
Copy the entire content from `lm_studio_system_prompt_new.txt` and paste it into your LM Studio system prompt field.

**Key features in the new prompt:**
- âœ… Distance selection guidelines (0.5 = short, 1.0 = medium, 3.0 = long)
- âœ… Contextual examples for different phrases
- âœ… New action format: `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":0.5}}`

### 2. Update JSON Schema
Copy the entire content from `lm_studio_schema.json` and paste it into your LM Studio JSON schema field.

**Key changes in the schema:**
- âœ… Removed old actions: `move_dir`, `move_short`, `move_long`
- âœ… Added new `move` action with `distance` parameter
- âœ… Distance validation: minimum 0.1, maximum 5.0

### 3. Restart LM Studio
- âœ… Completely close and restart LM Studio
- âœ… Reload your model
- âœ… Clear any conversation history

## ðŸŽ® Expected Behavior

Once configured, the LLM will respond with contextually appropriate distances:

| Player Input | Expected LLM Response | Distance | Pixels |
|--------------|----------------------|----------|---------|
| "step aside" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":0.5}}` | 0.5 tiles | 16 pixels |
| "move east" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":1.0}}` | 1.0 tiles | 32 pixels |
| "walk away" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"W","distance":3.0}}` | 3.0 tiles | 96 pixels |
| "move a bit" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":0.5}}` | 0.5 tiles | 16 pixels |
| "go far" | `{"action":"move","args":{"direction":"E","distance":3.0}}` | 3.0 tiles | 96 pixels |

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Quick Test (LM Studio running):
```bash
python test_llm_format_debug.py
```

### Full System Test:
```bash
python test_new_movement_system.py
```

### Distance Calculation Test:
```bash
python test_distance_calculation.py
```

## âœ… What's Working

1. **âœ… Action Parsing** - New format parses correctly
2. **âœ… Distance Calculation** - All distances from 0.5 to 4.0 tiles working
3. **âœ… Autonomous Movement** - Continues until target distance reached
4. **âœ… Validation** - Proper error handling for invalid inputs

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
- âœ… `NEW FORMAT DETECTED!` in debug tests
- âœ… Contextually appropriate distances chosen by LLM
- âœ… Smooth autonomous movement to exact distances
- âœ… No `move_dir` or `move_short` actions (old format)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If you still see old format responses:
1. âœ… Verify system prompt was completely replaced (not appended)
2. âœ… Verify JSON schema was completely replaced
3. âœ… Restart LM Studio completely
4. âœ… Clear conversation history
5. âœ… Check that JSON schema is enabled/active

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Use!

Once configured, your NPC will have intelligent, contextual movement that feels natural and responsive to player language!
