├── _execute_move_to() -> Enhanced with hierarchical pathfinding
├── current_waypoints -> Waypoint following
└── Observation -> Navigation status included
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Grid Setup**: O(n) where n = number of tiles
- **Region Building**: O(n) flood-fill algorithm
- **Portal Detection**: O(n) boundary scan
- **Path Queries**: O(log p) where p = number of portals
- **Real-world Performance**: <1ms on game-sized grids (25x20)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - only stores walkable grid and portal graph

## 🎮 Game Integration

### Automatic Integration
The navigation system integrates seamlessly with existing NPCs:

```python
# In game initialization
npc.llm_controller.initialize_navigation(grid_width, grid_height, walls)

# NPCs automatically use hierarchical navigation for move_to actions
# No changes needed to LLM prompts or action schemas
```

### Enhanced Observations
NPCs now receive navigation information in their observations:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "waypoints": [[12, 8], [15, 10]],
    "target": [20, 15]
  }
}
```

## 🔧 API Reference

### Main Classes

**HierarchicalNavigator**
```python
navigator = HierarchicalNavigator(grid_width, grid_height)
navigator.set_tiles_from_walls(walls)
navigator.build_regions_and_portals()

query = PathQuery(start_x, start_y, goal_x, goal_y)
response = navigator.find_path(query)
```

**PathQuery**
```python
PathQuery(
    start_x, start_y, goal_x, goal_y,
    cost_bias={"portal_1": 0.5},  # Optional
    prefer_indoor=True            # Optional
)
```

**PathResponse**
```python
response.ok          # bool: Success/failure
response.reason      # str: Error reason if failed
response.waypoints   # List[Tuple[float, float]]: Path waypoints
response.total_cost  # float: Total path cost
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Pathfinding
```python
navigator = HierarchicalNavigator(25, 18)
navigator.set_tiles_from_walls(wall_rectangles)
navigator.build_regions_and_portals()

query = PathQuery(100, 100, 500, 300)
response = navigator.find_path(query)

if response.ok:
    for waypoint in response.waypoints:
        print(f"Move to {waypoint}")
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Cost biasing
query = PathQuery(start_x, start_y, goal_x, goal_y, 
                 cost_bias={"door_2": 0.5})

# Indoor preference  
query = PathQuery(start_x, start_y, goal_x, goal_y, 
                 prefer_indoor=True)

# Dynamic portal control
navigator.set_portal_open("door_1", False)
```

### NPC Integration
```python
# Initialize in game setup
npc.llm_controller.initialize_navigation(grid_width, grid_height, walls)

# NPCs automatically use hierarchical navigation
# No additional code needed!
```
