# NPC Behavior Update Summary

## ✅ CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 🔇 **Default Behavior: Response-Only Mode**

**Problem:** NPC was speaking unprompted, making decisions on a timer even when player was silent.

**Solution:** Modified the decision-making logic to be much more conservative:

1. **Controller Changes** (`npc/controller.py`):
   - `should_make_decision()` now returns `False` by default unless player spoke
   - Added `_idle_behavior_enabled` flag (default: `False`)
   - Added `enable_idle_behavior()` method for easy control

2. **LLM Prompt Updates** (`npc/llm_client.py`):
   - Added explicit instruction: "ONLY speak when the player has spoken to you"
   - Emphasized waiting for player to initiate conversations
   - Prefer movement actions when player hasn't spoken

### 🎛️ **Configurable Idle Behavior**

**For Future Use:** Added toggle system for autonomous behavior:

```python
# Default: Only respond when spoken to
npc.llm_controller.enable_idle_behavior(False)

# Enable thinking out loud (20% chance of speech)
npc.llm_controller.enable_idle_behavior(True, speech_chance=0.2)

# Check current state
if npc.llm_controller.idle_behavior_enabled:
    print("NPC will act autonomously")
```

### 🎮 **Game Integration**

**Updated Files:**
- `zelda_game_with_llm_npc.py` - Added 'T' key to toggle idle behavior
- `zelda_game_llm_integration.py` - Default to response-only mode
- `README_LLM_NPC.md` - Documented behavior control

**New Controls:**
- **T Key**: Toggle idle behavior on/off during gameplay
- **Enter**: Talk to NPC (triggers response)
- **Movement**: NPC will only move/act when player speaks (default)

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

```bash
python test_npc_behavior.py
```

**Results:**
- ✅ NPC stays silent when player hasn't spoken
- ✅ NPC responds when player speaks  
- ✅ Idle behavior toggle works correctly
- ✅ No unexpected autonomous speech

## 📋 **Behavior Summary**

### **Default Mode (Recommended)**
- NPC only makes decisions when player speaks
- No autonomous movement or speech
- Responsive and predictable behavior
- Conserves LLM API calls

### **Idle Mode (Optional)**
- NPC occasionally acts autonomously (every ~32 seconds when player nearby)
- Configurable speech probability (0-100%)
- Can think out loud, move around, examine items
- More dynamic but uses more API calls

## 🎯 **Usage Instructions**

### **For Current Use:**
```python
# Create NPC that only responds when spoken to
shopkeeper = create_llm_shopkeeper(400, 250)
# Default behavior is already response-only
```

### **For Future Experimentation:**
```python
# Enable occasional autonomous behavior
shopkeeper.llm_controller.enable_idle_behavior(True, speech_chance=0.1)

# During gameplay, press 'T' to toggle on/off
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

**Decision Logic:**
1. **Player Speaks** → Always trigger NPC decision
2. **Player Silent + Idle Disabled** → No decision
3. **Player Silent + Idle Enabled + Player Nearby + Timer Expired** → Possible decision

**Timing:**
- **Response Mode**: Immediate when player speaks
- **Idle Mode**: Every 32+ seconds when conditions met
- **Error Backoff**: 2 seconds after consecutive failures

**LLM Instructions:**
- Explicit guidance to only speak when `player.last_said` is not null
- Prefer movement actions when player is silent
- Keep responses under 10 words when speaking

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The NPC now behaves exactly as requested:
- **Silent by default** - only speaks when spoken to
- **Easily configurable** - can enable idle behavior for testing
- **Future-ready** - framework in place for autonomous behavior
- **Well-tested** - verified with automated tests

The chatty NPC issue is resolved! 🎉
